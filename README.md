What is VC-Toggle-Switch?
===================================

This is a little toggle I made that is completely independent of framework. It is highly customizable, and will look good within any app.

Why?
===================================

I made this so I could use it inside an AngularJS (1.0.0) app, and I think your reasons should be the same: you're looking for something that will work anywhere, and that looks good.

How do I use this?
===================================

This toggle was made in a way that you won't need much (or any) CSS to adapt it into your app. It also should be very plug'n play. This is an easy example of its implementation:

    <div class="vc-toggle-container">
      <label class="vc-switch">
        <input type="checkbox" class="vc-switch-input" />
        <span class="vc-switch-label" data-on="Yes" data-off="No"></span>
        <span class="vc-handle"></span>
      </label>
    </div>

This is the basic structure that will generate the default toggle. Also, don't forget to import its CSS file into your HTML:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="vc-toggle-switch.css" />

How do I change its visual?
===================================

That sould be very simple, here's an example of a customized toggle:

      <div 
        style="
          --vc-off-color: blue;
          --vc-on-color: blue;
          --vc-on-font-color: red;
          --vc-off-font-color: red;
        "
        class="text-center d-inline-block"
      >
        <div class="vc-toggle-container">
          <label class="vc-switch">
            <input type="checkbox" class="vc-switch-input" />
            <span 
              data-on="Yes" 
              data-off="No"
              class="vc-switch-label"
            ></span>
            <span class="vc-handle"></span>
          </label>
        </div>
      </div>

As you can see, all you have to do is add the CSS properties you want to change in the style of the outermost main div.
